I recently started a new project.

Here's a sidenote{{sidenote: Sidenotes appear in the margin on wide screens}} in action.
## Text Formatting

You can write in **bold**, *italic*, or use `inline code`.

Here's a sidenote{{sidenote: Sidenotes appear in the margin on wide screens}} in action.

## Links and Images

Link to [Google](https://google.com) or another page.

Add an image:

<img src="../images/blue.png" alt="blue image">

## Code Blocks

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("world"))
```

## Math

Inline math like $E = mc^2$ or $\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.

Display math on its own line:

$$\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$$

## Lists

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

That's everything you need to write posts!
