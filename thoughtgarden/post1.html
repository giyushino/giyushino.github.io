        “Who am I?” is a question every human who has escaped an existence of solely hunting and foraging to survive (meaning everyone reading this)
        has asked themselves at least once. Even though this question in it of itself doesn’t carry a negative connotation, for many, it very much does.
        To be fair, when asked this, certain people may already have an answer ready, or are comfortable enough with their identity that they can arrive
        at an answer immediately. Congratulations to these individuals! They have overcome existentialism and will live fruitful lives!

      </p>
      <p>
        But what about the rest of us? What do we do when we are faced with one of the fundamental questions of life and can’t produce a response?
        First, let us feel consoled in the fact that the previous type of person is very rare, and in many cases, they may be conflating their identity
        with an entirely separate aspect of life, which I will explain later. An important fact we should take note of is that this question often arises
        when feelings of doubt plague the mind, which often stem from failure, rejection, and other forms of hardship.

      </p>
      <p>
        For example, let’s consider the scenarios of a professional pole vaulter who fails to qualify for the Olympics for the third time,
        a senior in college who gets rejected from every PhD program,  a CS student unable to land an internship after hundreds of applications,
        and a neglected housewife trapped in a loveless marriage. It wouldn’t be too much of a stretch to assume that these people would eventually
        reach a point where they question their entire identity.

      </p>
      <p>
        But what exactly causes these feelings of doubt to surface? In my opinion, it largely stems from a lack of certainty in the future,
        rather than anything internal. An athlete who achieved their lifelong dream of competing in the Olympics would experience less dissonance
        between their envisioned future and reality, which gives doubt fewer chances to surface. Similarly, this would be the case for a student who
        breezed through their studies and got accepted into a prestigious PhD program with a generous stipend.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, the student who was banking on going to graduate school, regardless of if it was a goal or dream of theirs, would have their
        entire world upturned when they get rejected. The housewife who once envisioned fostering a healthy, happy family would realize their future
        is impossible to reach with her inattentive husband. As reality shatters their visions of the future, the cracks left in their psyche allow
        negative feelings to fester in their mind. Everything comes into question, such as “Why did I want this?” “What will I do now?”
        “What do I truly want?”, and “Why did I want that before?”. Eventually, everything coalesces into THE question: “Who am I?”
      </p>
      <p>
        I might be losing you at this point, but bear with me for a bit longer. It’s almost time to make my main point! But before I do so,
        I’d like to share a quick anecdote. For the better part of last year, I have a very definite plan and idea of what my future entailed.
        Every single thing I did day to day, at least in some part, was to bring life to this dream of mine. However, as life often works out,
        I was faced with the harsh reality that this future was no longer in the cards for me. In a single day, my dreams, hopes, and aspirations were shattered. Without the motivation to work towards this goal of mine, I fell into a deep depression, but quite interestingly, I completely lost my sense of self.
      </p>
      <p>
        But why would the loss of this future, which wouldn’t even be available to me until decades later,
        bring into doubt my current identity? While I couldn't gather myself to do any soul-searching at the time,
        I think I've somewhat figured it out by now. I confused who I was with what I wished for. In other words,
        I conflated my sense of self with a theoretical future. I didn’t see myself as Allan, I relegated myself to someone who merely
        worked to make a future, ideal Allan exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem with this lies in the fact that we cannot control the future. Granted, we can do certain things to tip the odds in our favor,
        but we can NEVER ensure something occurs. Hypothetical, let’s say that my dream is to go to Princeton University for graduate school (it’s not).
        I could work tirelessly towards making this as close to a reality as possible by studying diligently, conducting research at labs, reaching out to
        professors, reading literature, etc., but at the end of the day, my fate isn't ENTIRELY in my own hands. The admission officer reading my application
        could be having a terrible day, they could be biased against UCLA students, and so much more.
      </p>
      <p>
        The point of this hypothetical wasn’t to make excuses for rejection
        (just work hard without the fear of failure plaguing you in the back of your mind!),
        but to demonstrate that sometimes things are truly out of our control.
        As a result, something we have no control over should similarly have no significance of defining us as individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don’t conflate your goals with your identity! You are so much more than that. Instead, I propose this to you; first, find several ideals and
        convictions you can confidently stand by. Some of my (less personal) beliefs are that people should strive to understand the world around them,
        treat everyone with respect, and that financial freedom contributes to happiness. From this foundation, I may focus on how I want to act and
        express myself, as well as eventually planning on goals I would like to achieve. Dreams are a bit more spontaneous, but they are just as important.
      </p>
      <p>
        Say from my first ideal, I make it a point to be well-read, studious, and perpetually curious. This, in tandem with my third ideal, might lead me to
        form the goal of going to graduate school. Not only would it allow me to better understand the world, but it would also enable me to potentially
        land a higher paying job, which could help my future family live a happier life. But if I were to fail to get into graduate school, my core tenets
        and beliefs should remain firm, as should my identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, to answer the question I posed VERY early on, what should we do when we don't have an answer to "Who am I?", take a minute to find your ideals
        and convictions. Don't let moments of weakness or setbacks to make your belief in yourself waver. Believe yourself, trust yourself, damn it!
      </p>
      <p>
        Although intertwined, my aspirations and sense of self are inherently not the same. As a result, no matter what happens in life, I can stay true to myself.
        Or that's the plan I guess.
