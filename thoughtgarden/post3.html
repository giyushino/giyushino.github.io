                        through time

                        thoughts fill the room; the words exchanged between the two 
                        merely serve to capture fragments of the primordial. 
                        though poorly worded and riddled with logical flaws, 
                        the conversation is riveting, lasting late into the night. 
                        differing convictions clash; differing points diffuse through 
                        the small cuts left in each other's defense. 
                        by chance their paths crossed, and by chance again 
                        their paths diverge. 
                        oh, how i lament fate! at times a favorable friend, 
                        i look with disdain at the fickle foe one has become!
                        ironic, it is, the spontaneity of the present we praise 
                        is the same randomness of the future we detest.
                        despite the 4th dimension, and through the 2nd dimension,

      <pre>
      wait for me

      wait until the world falls asleep,
and when not a soul stirs ’cept for yours,
let the walls of your heart fall.
take a step into the garden of the soul,
unfettered by the mind’s shackles.
pluck the wilting rose by the roadside;
wonder not why it smells sharply of iron
and return it. bloodied, continue on
exploring the flora to your heart’s content.
when the world begins to rouse,
spare a moment to find the rose once more.
petals to nose, inhale deeply and laugh;
sweet, floral, fruity, not a trace of metal
can be detected
