    <h2>Who am I?</h2>

      <p>
        There are plenty of moments in a person's life when they'll question their sense of identity, asking
        themselves the fundamental question: "Who am I?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Most commonly, feelings of doubt regarding one's self rise during times of failure, rejection, and other
        forms of hardship. An extremely high performing athlete failing to qualify for the Olympics for the 3rd time,
        a senior college student failing to get into a good PhD program, a CS student unable to land an internship despite
        hundreds of applications, and a housewife stuck in a loveless marriage will all
        likely begin to question their identity at one point in time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my opinion, this doubt stems from a lack of uncertainty in the future, as well as the falling through
        of a dream/plan, rather than anything internal or conflicts in their character. An athlete who qualified for
        the Olympics would likely have few catalysts for feelings of doubt to arise, as would a student breezing through their
        studies and getting accepted into a prestigious PhD program with a generous stipend.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inversely, another student who was banking on going to graduate school, whether it was a dream or goal of theirs, would
        have their entire world upturned when they failed to do so. A housewife who once envisioned having a calm, happy family life
        would realize that future is impossible to reach with her inattentive husband. As reality shatters these people's visions of the futures,
        everything comes into question. Why did I want this? What will happen to me now? What do I want now? Why did I want that before?
        And eventually everything coalesces into THE question: Who am I?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, this is just my theory and something I personally experienced. Without going into much detail, just a few months ago, I had a very definite vision
        of the future. However, as certain events unfolded, I quickly realized this future was no longer in the cards for me. In a single day,
        my dreams were shattered, and I was left without a goal to work towards. Everything I previously did was all for this dream to be realized,
        and without this motivation, I fell into a deep, dark abyss.  While I was certainly depressed, more interestingly, I completely lost my sense of self.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simply because this future was inaccessible to me, doubt regarding my character flooded my mind. I no longer knew who I was, what I wanted to do,
        or what motivated me anymore. While I couldn't gather myself to do any soul-searching at the time, I think I've somewhat figured it by now. In the past, my entire identity was tied to this future; I dedicated every waking moment to envisioning how wonderful my life could be and
        what I needed to do to make it a reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, we cannot control the future. Yes, we can do things to turn the odds in our favor, but we ensure that something occurs. For example, let's say
        my dream is to go to graduate school at Princeton University(it's not). I could work tirelessly towards to make this as close of a reality as possible
        by studying diligently, conducing research at labs, reaching out professors, reading literature, etc., but at the end of the day, my fate isn't ENTIRELY
        in my own hands. The admission officer reading my application could be having a terrible day, they could have a bias against UCLA students, and so much more.
      </p>
      <p>
        My message isn't to make a point about making excuses for rejection. Just work as hard as you can without this fear of failing plaguing you in the
        back of the mind. What I want to convey is that you should not conflate your identity with a goal. You are so much more than your goal of being a doctor,
        athlete, engineer, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, you need to find some ideals and convictions you stand by. Once you have these established, build your sense of identity from there.
        For example, these are some of my ideals/convictions/beliefs: People should strive to understand the world around them, treat everyone with respect,
        financial freedom contributes to a happy family life. From these ideals, I may focus on how I want to act, and from there, I can decide on goals and dreams
        I would like to achieve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Say from my 1st ideal, I make it a point to be well-read, studious, and try hard in school. This, in tandem with my 3rd belief, might lead me to make
        it my goal to go to graduate school. Not only would it help me understand the world better, but it would also enable to land a higher paying
        job to support my future family. But if I were to fail to get into graduate school, my fundamental core beliefs and values shouldn't be shaken.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although intertwined, my aspirations and sense of self are inherently not the same. As a result, no matter what happens in life, I can stay true
        to myself. Or that's the plan I guess.
      </p>
