                <p >
                 I'm Allan, a frosh studying applied mathematics, but I am looking to tack on another major. I'm currently pretty interested in machine learning, specifically the fields of computer vision and LMMs. However, I know myself well enough to know that my interests can change at the drop of a hat. While I'm not exactly sure what I'll be doing in the future, I am pretty keen on going to graduate school and conducting research related to machine learning.

                Currently, I'm working as a research assistant at BigML @ UCLA, where I'm currently helping a graduate student study where and why multimodal models fail at spatial reasoning tasks. It has been an extremely fulfilling experience and I have learned a lot. When I'm not working on research, I enjoy reading and creating my own personal projects. Since I only started learning to code a few months ago, I've been trying to code as much as possible. While I have mostly been working with Python and machine learning, I hope to expand my skillset to C++ (maybe gamedev?). </p>
                <p>My current project involves testing different methods of finetuning an LLM to become an optimal math agent. I have been experimenting and studying how datasets, model architecture, compute power, prompting, low rank adaption, and other factors can affect the model's performance.

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            What are humans apart from our memories? Strip them away from us and what do we become? With this site, I hope to keep a record of my thought process, works, and life in general. Even though I have only been in college for a few months, I've come to understand how fast paced life can be, and how fleeting moments are. Without any pictures or written records, I find myself wondering how exactly I felt at certain points my life, or what exactly I did. I feel dissapointed by the fact that my truimphs, failures, and thoughts are essentially lost to time due to my negligence.
