 I'm Allan, a frosh studying applied mathematics, but I am looking to tack on another major. I'm currently
      pretty interested in machine learning, specifically the fields of computer vision and LMMs. However, I know myself
      well enough to know that my interests can change at the drop of a hat. While I'm not exactly sure what I'll be doing in the
      future, I am pretty keen on going to graduate school and conducting research related to machine learning.

Currently, I'm working as a research assistant at BigML @ UCLA, where I'm currently helping a graduate student study where and why multimodal models fail at spatial reasoning tasks. It has been an extremely fulfilling experience and I have learned a lot. When I'm not working on research, I enjoy reading and creating my own personal projects. I began to learn to code just a few months ago, and I have been enjoying creating small Python projects. I just finished up creating my own doodle guesser, which you can read more about in the projects section of this site.
