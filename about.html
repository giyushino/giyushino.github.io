    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Allan, a frosh attending UCLA. I'm currently studying Applied Mathematics, but I am looking to tack on another major. I'm currently
      pretty interested in machine learning, specifically the fields of computer vision and LMMs. However, I know myself
      well enough to know that my interests can change at the drop of a hat. While I'm not exactly sure what I'll be doing in the
      future, I am pretty keen on going to graduate school and conducting research related to machine learning.

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      I plan on writing about my academic endeavors in an effort to better understand what I'm learning. After all, if you can't explain something simply,
      you probably don't have a deep enough understanding of the subject. Or you're just shit at explaining because you're a genius (probably something a lot of professors suffer from).</p>

    <p> While I've always known that there's almost an infinite number of things to learn, this fact was truly realized for me when I started college.
      However, there's one main caveat (probably more) that come with this blessing; With an "infinite" amount of knowledge waiting for us, people may
      attempt to "learn" as much as possible. However, many go about this by trying to memorize as much as possible, which is probably the worst method
      to "learn". A fact, theorem, definition crammed into your mind is just one more thing you'll forget. </p>

    <p>
      I'm guilty of this, especially as educational institutions
      reward students for memorizing information for exams. However, as I begin to slowly begin to specialize in a field, it's integral that I truly understand everything
      I learn now. By explaining what I learn, I seek to derive a more fundamental
      understanding of the topic, which will give me the necessary foundation to explore more complex concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll also write about life and shit, but I'm no philosopher.
    </p>
